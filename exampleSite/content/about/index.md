This artistic portfolio is a website that I created using a Hugo theme from Netifly to display my artistic projects and pieces. I edited the website in VS Code using HTML and CSS. The website includes pictures that I have taken and edited throughout my life and travels as well as Musical and theatrical performances I've been a part of. As I continue to edit, partake, and make art I will upload everything here.

This page goes more in depth to each section of the website.
